## Liteflix

This web application retrieves data from https://api.themoviedb.org/ to display a highlighted movie as the featured movie and 4 other popular movies in a caroussel with a Netflix-ish design
It also allows the user to upload a movie poster and title, and later check the list of movies added by the user

This is a web fullstack coding challenge for Litebox, a company that builds web and mobile apps for clients in the United States. 
Their main focus is in delivering high end products with outstanding UI design and experience

This coding challenge showcases my abilities as a fullstack developer by coding the interface in React from a Figma file and retrieving data from an outside API as well as building an API of my own to save and retrieve user data

It's built using Next.js, with Styled Components on the frontend and Next-Connect, Typegoose, MongoDB and Multer on the backend
